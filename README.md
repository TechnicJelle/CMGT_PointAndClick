A hectic and fast-paced game about cleaning up after a giant party before your parents come home (<-- this should also be improved)

## How to play
Due to Processing problems, I couldn't manage to export the game as a playable executable.\
So for now, you need to install [Processing **3.5.4**](https://processing.org/download) itself, [download the project](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/CMGT_PointAndClick/releases/latest), open it in Processing and run it from there...
